# INTROSPECTION

## Why must we choose you?
I've known coding from my class 11th, and I've always liked solving problems given in class with a accurate and quick solutions. Even if I couldn't complete them, I never stopped trying. I am curious about how things work and about what is behind the screens of a webpage or an app. I became very much interested in coding after seeing my friend develop his own linux based OS and discord bot which is currently used by about 2k servers. I was completely mind blown by their achievemts which made me interested in coding. I think amfoss will guide me to the path where i can learn more about my passion. I believe that I have got what it takes to be part of amFOSS. I also believe that I can develop my skills by joining you guys.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I realised that I lacked in my programming knowledge after attempting the questions and tasks. I wish to learn how to solve the harder problems. I would also like to learn more programming languages. I want to progress as much as I can without falling behind in my academics.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will use the best of my abilities to help the club and its members with any help they require. I would do my best to achieve something great for the club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process overall is great as it has various levels of difficulty for various type of students. We could learn a lot just by doing the tasks and following the advices of the seniors. It was a great experience as it was fun at some time and frustrating at some others.
