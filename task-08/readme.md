# Task-08

This was the first task I did after task 3.
The task was easy as the instructions were pretty easy to follow. 
It was interesting choosing the various fonts and colors.
It was confusing at the start as I was using HTML after 5 years and forgot most of the syntax.
Overall it was an easy task.
